      # By default this is published on all host interfaces (0.0.0.0).
      # To keep it reachable for all devices in your LAN while avoiding WAN exposure,

  # Optional HA sidecar (VRRP/VIP via keepalived)
  # - Always included so users can enable HA from the UI without editing compose files.
  # - Does nothing until the UI writes /data/sentinel/ha/config.json (enabled=true).
  # - Requires Linux host networking and capabilities to add/remove the VIP on your LAN interface.
