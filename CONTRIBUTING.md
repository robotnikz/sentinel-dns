# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to Sentinel-DNS.

## Quick guidelines

- Please use GitHub Issues for bugs and feature requests.
- Keep pull requests focused (one problem per PR).
- Prefer small, reviewable changes over large rewrites.

For questions and setup help, please use GitHub Discussions.

## Development setup

Development docs are intentionally kept out of the public-facing README.

- See [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for local setup, scripts, and troubleshooting.

## Commit style

If you can, use Conventional Commits (this repo uses automated releases).

Examples:

- `feat: add xyz`
- `fix: handle abc`
- `docs: update README`

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive. See [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
