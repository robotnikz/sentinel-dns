# Code of Conduct

We want Sentinel-DNS to be a welcoming project for everyone.

## Our standards

We expect all participants to:

- Be respectful and constructive
- Assume good intent; disagree on ideas, not people
- Avoid harassment, discrimination, and personal attacks
- Respect privacy and do not share other peoples' private information

## Scope

This applies to all project spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions) and any direct communication about the project.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may:

- Ask for changes to behavior
- Remove content that violates this Code of Conduct
- Temporarily or permanently restrict participation in the project

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- Open a GitHub issue (if it is not sensitive), or
- Use the repository's security reporting channel for sensitive reports.
